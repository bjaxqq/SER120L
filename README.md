### Grading
Your final grade will be evaluated as an aggregate of each Lab completed in the course. There will be no tests or quizzes! Your grade will be determined by the quality of your lab assignments based on the grading rubric. 

### Grading Rubric
Note: If your code is correct, only then the readability and comments points are relevant. For example, in case if you are awarded “F” for “Correctness” then you’d be awarded “F” for “Readability” and “Comments” as well.
